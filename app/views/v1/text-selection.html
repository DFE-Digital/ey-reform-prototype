                      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="the-importance-of-practitioner-wellbeing">The importance of practitioner wellbeing</h2>
                      <p class="govuk-body">Working in early years can be enjoyable and rewarding, but also challenging. It is essential that early years practitioners feel properly supported. Part of this is ensuring they feel happy and fulfilled both inside and outside of work. Improving practitioner wellbeing practice can improve both how individual practitioners feel, and the setting as a whole. This creates a positive environment for practitioners and children, which in turn can: </p>
                      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                        <li>reduce absence</li>
                        <li>increase productivity</li>
                        <li>improve practitioner retention</li>
                      </ul>
                      
                      <p class="govuk-body">
                        Better practitioner wellbeing is also a factor in children's personal, social and emotional development. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zlIeq3RQIE">staff wellbeing video</a> from the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families explains how managing wellbeing can help you to develop stonger relationships with children and support their emotional regulation. This is particularly important if you work with children who have their own emotional difficulties.
                      </p>
                      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="case-studies">Case studies</h2>
                      <p class="govuk-body">There are many different ways in which you can support practitioner wellbeing. In these case studies, 3 providers explain their approach to maintaining wellbeing in their settings.  
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Explorers Day Care </h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Explorers Day Care is a private nursery in Bishop Auckland, in rural County Durham. The nursery is based on a working farm and employs 25 members of staff. </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Manager Jenna Whitaker says:</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">“At Explorers, we place a big emphasis on the leadership support our staff receive, and how it feels to work in our setting. Our staff work flexibly on a four day working pattern. This helps them to achieve a good work life balance while still maintaining relationships with the children. We also strive to be as accommodating as possible when staff are dealing with personal matters and will adjust rotas to ease the pressure. </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">We think a lot about added value, and how we can strip away any unnecessary activities that take away time from interacting with children. This this makes a big difference to workload. Our staff are empowered to speak about their children without having to record and document everything. Parents and carers are also happy with verbal handovers when they come to collect their children at the end of the day.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Being situated on a working farm, we spend time outdoors every day, come rain or shine. As well as the obvious benefits for children’s development, this also makes a huge difference to staff wellbeing.</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">When a new staff member joins, we add a group activity of their choice to a bag, like climbing a mountain or going out for tea. On birthdays we pick from the bag and all enjoy the activity. We also provide a buffet spread for staff once a month, and do voluntary fundraising activities, which is great for team-building. </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Finally, I think it's really important that staff feel valued. I always tell my team they are the setting’s biggest resource.” </p>
                
                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Karla Roberts</h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Karla Roberts runs a childminding business in Gretton, a village in Northamptonshire. She has two part-time assistants.  </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Karla says:</p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">“Wellbeing is a fundamental priority when working in early years. As a childminder, I can plan my day around my own needs and those of the children and other adults I work with. This ensures we can prioritise our own wellbeing. If we feel under the weather, for example, we can choose to have a slower paced day. I also plan a lot of time outdoors, which I know keeps myself, my assistants, and the children happy.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Being able to compartmentalise is also a key skill. I think it’s very important that we don’t strive to be happy or perfect all the time. That’s a lot of pressure to deal with on an average working day. It’s also essential to not overcommit as a childminder. Keeping the day simple and organised is the best way to maintain a sense of calm. </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Professional support is also necessary. As childminders we often work alone, so talking to others is the best thing we can do to prevent feeling isolated. Engaging via informal groups online creates a supportive environment within the sector and brings us together. This means we can discuss the stress of the role with someone who understands, as well as share best practice.” </p>
                   
                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Ark Start </h3>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Ark Start is a school-based nursery. It operates from two Ark schools in London, Ark John Archer Primary Academy in Battersea and Ark Start Oval in Croydon. Ark Start employs around 20 practitioners across both settings.   </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">Director Katie Oliver says: </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">“We believe that high quality leadership and management are essential to ensure that the structure of our setting promotes good staff wellbeing.   
                    </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">For instance, we try to limit the amount of admin staff must do. This allows them to focus on their role as educators. We schedule time for necessary tasks within their working hours, but keep it separate from the time they have with the children. </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">We also conduct termly anonymous staff surveys, with specific questions about staff wellbeing. This helps to keep management informed and allows staff to voice how they are feeling.  
                        Making sure staff feel valued is fundamental to a positive work environment – and it’s free. As part of this, we refer to all our staff as educators. We hope that this creates a culture where there is no hierarchy, and everyone feels respected.
                        </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">We are also committed to supporting the professional development and continuous learning of our staff. We want to ensure they feel we invest in them, so we schedule in time specifically for this purpose. This takes many forms, including  – online and in-person training. We also visit other settings to learn about practice in different environments.” </p>
